# Using MDX

This article explains how to use MDX files in your project.
It shows how you can pass props and how to import, define, or pass components. {/* more */}
See [§ Getting started][start] for how to integrate MDX into your project.
To understand how the MDX format works, we recommend that you start with
[§ What is MDX][what].

## How MDX works

An integration compiles MDX syntax to JavaScript.
Say we have an MDX document, `example.mdx`:

```mdx path="input.mdx"
export const Thing = () => <>World</>;

# Hello <Thing />
```

That’s _roughly_ turned into the following JavaScript.
The below might help to form a mental model:

```js path="output-outline.jsx"

```

Some observations:

- The output is serialized JavaScript that still needs to be evaluated
- A comment is injected to configure how JSX is handled
- It’s a complete file with import/exports
- A component (`MDXContent`) is exported
